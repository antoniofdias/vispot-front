        "\r\n\r\nwhen i was younger\r\ni saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind\r\nhe broke his own heart and i watched\r\nas he tried to reassemble it\r\nand my mama swore that she would\r\nnever let herself forget\r\nand that was the day that i promised\r\ni'd never sing of love if it does not exist\r\n\r\nbut, darling\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\n\r\nmaybe i know, somewhere\r\ndeep in my soul, that love never lasts\r\nand we've got to find other ways\r\nto make it alone, but keep a straight face\r\nand i've always lived like this\r\nkeeping a comfortable distance\r\nand up until now, i had sworn to myself\r\nthat i'm content with loneliness\r\nbecause none of it was ever worth the risk\r\n\r\nwell, you are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\n\r\ni've got a tight grip on reality\r\nbut i can't, let go of what's in front of me here\r\ni know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up\r\nleave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream\r\n\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\n\r\nand i'm on my way to believing\r\noh, and i'm on my way to believing\r\n",
