        "\r\n\r\ncaught in the dark with a sound in my heart\r\nhiding alone down on the floor\r\nout of my depth and i'm holding my breath\r\ndon't wanna go outside the door\r\n\r\nparalyzed by my own emotion\r\nout of my mind, looking for a way out of here, out of here\r\nterrified and my feet are frozen\r\nsomething inside got me wondering is this real?\r\nis this real?\r\n\r\ni'm hearing voices in my head\r\ni don't wanna hear, i don't wanna fear\r\nsay you ain't afraid of nothing\r\neverybody is scared of something, woo-hoo\r\n\r\nsmoke in my chest from my last cigarette\r\nand the dog start to howl at the moon\r\nblack silhouettes gonna haunt me again\r\ncreeping out from the shadows of the room\r\n\r\nparalyzed by my own emotions\r\nsomething inside got me wondering is this real?\r\nis this real?\r\n\r\ni'm hearing voices in my head\r\ni don't wanna hear, i don't wanna fear\r\ni'm seeing monsters in my bed\r\ni don't wanna see, i don't wanna fear\r\nsay you ain't afraid of nothing\r\neverybody is scared of something, woo-hoo\r\n\r\ni wanna let you know\r\ni ain't afraid no more\r\ni wanna let you know\r\n\r\ni'm hearing voices in my head\r\ni don't wanna hear, i don't wanna fear\r\ni'm seeing monsters in my bed\r\ni don't wanna see, i don't wanna fear, wooh-wooh\r\ni wanna let you know\r\ni wanna let you know\r\ni wanna let you know\r\nsaying you ain't afraid of nothing\r\neverybody is scared of something, woo-hoo\r\n",

        "\r\n\r\nwhen i was younger\r\ni saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind\r\nhe broke his own heart and i watched\r\nas he tried to reassemble it\r\nand my mama swore that she would\r\nnever let herself forget\r\nand that was the day that i promised\r\ni'd never sing of love if it does not exist\r\n\r\nbut, darling\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\n\r\nmaybe i know, somewhere\r\ndeep in my soul, that love never lasts\r\nand we've got to find other ways\r\nto make it alone, but keep a straight face\r\nand i've always lived like this\r\nkeeping a comfortable distance\r\nand up until now, i had sworn to myself\r\nthat i'm content with loneliness\r\nbecause none of it was ever worth the risk\r\n\r\nwell, you are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\n\r\ni've got a tight grip on reality\r\nbut i can't, let go of what's in front of me here\r\ni know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up\r\nleave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream\r\n\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\nyou are the only exception\r\n\r\nand i'm on my way to believing\r\noh, and i'm on my way to believing\r\n",

(i'm not okay)\r\ni've told you time and time again\r\nyou sing the words but don't know what it means (i'm not okay)\r\nto be a joke and look\r\nanother line without a hook\r\ni held you close as we both shook\r\nfor the last time, take a good hard look\r\n\r\ni'm not okay\r\ni'm not okay\r\ni'm not okay\r\nyou wear me out\r\n\r\nforget about the dirty looks\r\nthe photographs your boyfriend took\r\nyou said you read me like a book\r\nbut the pages all are torn and frayed\r\ni'm okay, i'm okay, i'm okay now (i'm okay, now)\r\nbut you really need to listen to me\r\nbecause i'm telling you the truth\r\ni mean this, i'm okay! (trust me)\r\n\r\ni'm not okay\r\ni'm not okay\r\nwell, i'm not okay, i'm not o-fucking-kay\r\ni'm not okay\r\ni'm not okay\r\n",
